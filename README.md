Simple testing module for running tests for your MC with build-in CC:T support!
This is just simple recap of CC:T testing tool, performed to be used in my projects

## How to setup it? 

So, there is no simple way, actually

1. Take latest version for `"site.siredvin.ttoolkit:TestToolkit` from `https://repo.repsy.io/mvn/siredvin/default/`,
2. Create `testMod` in your mod version. You can see examples in CC:T repository or this repository
3. Copy accesstransformers.cfg from this repository to your test mod
4. Add some tests, you can find example here or in CC:T, Progressive Peripherals or Advanced Peripheral repository
5. Have fun!
